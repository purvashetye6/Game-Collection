# Game-Collection
This project is a Python-based game collection application built using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It includes three mini-games: Rock Paper Scissors, Slot Machine, and Guess the Number. The application provides an interactive and fun way to play these games with simple and easy-to-use controls.
